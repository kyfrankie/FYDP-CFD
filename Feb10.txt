	For NACA case:

##General flow settings (updated on Feb 2021)
	For Re 200000, and U_inf = 23.0 m/s
dynamic viscosity is 1.856e-05 Pa s (source: EngineeringToolBox with 25 deg C)
the kinematic viscosity is 1.5589e-05 m^2 /s, meaning the rho is 1.191 kg/m^3
*kinematic viscosity is inputted into the ```constant/transportProperties``` as well

Stagnation/Dynamic pressure should be 315 Pa

##Wing information

area is around 
0.0421875 m^2 for base wing
0.04554504 m^2 for tipped wing

MAC is
0.135556 m

##Mesh information
Y+ 30
mainwing FLT = 0.0004
wingtip FLT = 0.00033

Y+ 39
mainwing FLT = 0.00052
wingtip FLT = 0.00042

Y+ 5
mainwing FLT = 0.0000667
wingtip FLT = 0.000055

## Remarks for inlet and outlet conditions

At the outlet of the model (also in any region), the typical boundary condition for pressure is fixed static pressure. For all the other quantities a typical choice is zeroGradient.
